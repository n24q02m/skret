## 2026-05-07 - Insufficient Redaction of Complex Secrets
**Vulnerability:** Secrets (tokens, passwords) were not redacted if they were embedded within larger strings (e.g., error messages) or if the attribute key name indicated sensitivity but the value didn't match a specific pattern.
**Learning:** Fixed-pattern matching at the start/end of a string is insufficient for log redaction. Heuristic key-based redaction and global regex replacement are necessary to catch secrets in varied contexts.
**Prevention:** Implement heuristic key-based redaction and use global regex replacement for secret patterns. Complement with a safe fast-path check for performance.

## 2026-05-07 - Prevent Command and Flag Injection in OpenBrowser
**Vulnerability:** The `OpenBrowser` function in `internal/auth/prompt.go` accepted unsanitized URLs, potentially allowing command and flag injection if a malicious URL (like `file:///etc/passwd` or an argument like `--help`) was passed.
**Learning:** Functions that execute system commands, like `exec.CommandContext`, are vulnerable to injection attacks if input is not validated and appropriately formatted. In macOS's `open` command, specifically, missing the argument separator (`--`) leaves it vulnerable to flag injection.
**Prevention:** Always validate URLs against expected schemas (e.g., `http` and `https`) before passing them to the system command. For commands like `open` on `darwin`, utilize the `--` separator to explicitly denote that the following values are arguments, not flags.
